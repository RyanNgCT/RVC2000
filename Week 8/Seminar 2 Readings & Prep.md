## Tapestry: The Heart of ASEAN - S1E4: Finding ASEAN's Roots

### Case Study 1: Quang Binh, Vietnam
- Vietnam's narrowest province
- houses a lot of cave structures
	- entrance to Vietnam's cave kingdom $\ge 300$ caves
	- Phong Nha - Ke Bang National Park, a UNESCO world heritage site

**Local Government efforts to promote sustainability efforts**
- tourists should come to enjoy the nature and wildlife in the area
- capital of caving adventure in Asia in the near future

- government masterplan for tourism and sustainability
	- limit of 1000 people who can visit the caves annually
	- preserving the structural integrity of the caves

**Flooding in Quang Binh Province**
- 2010, huge flood
- locals think about new ideas
- Quang Binh used to be a stopover, visitors don't stay overnight $\implies$leads to lower number of job opportunities for local residents
	- not enough traffic to sell products

**Oxalis**
- a local-centric tour company, with local guides as the priority for hires
- also has a cafe
- looking after tourists $\implies$ tourist staying 3 to 4 days (improvement in tourist number retention)
	- more opportunities for locals and tourists to contribute to the local economy as stats show that tourists spend more time there

**Eco-Tourism**
- (Hang) Son Doong is the largest cave in the world, spending over 9 km.
	- monitoring the environmental impact of tourism in the area
	- Have alternatives that are smaller that tourists with limited time to travel in.

- scenery in the caves attract tourists
	- tourist walking in single files $\implies$ avoid destruction of formations
	- diverse ecosystem in the cave
	- getting busy, but not getting damaged (finding the right balance between tourist numbers and natural conservation)

- has local homestays for tourist to experience living in the small village
	- authentic cultural experiences $\implies$ backpackers and tourists don't really want to stay in hotels and hostels
	- list homestays on booking websites to enable them to be more accessible by foreign tourists who may be interested in staying there.
		- most of the local farmers are involved in leasing these spaces
		- connects locals with tourists for additional income and benefit to the area

	- training for locals from the government's department of tourism
		- promoting of local cultures like in skills like pottery
		- raise the education level through english lessons for locals

**Agriculture**
- still remains a big part of the employment sector in Quang Binh, aside from ecotourism efforts like Caves and Homestays

### Case Study 2: Sapulot, Sabah
- in the heart of Borneo
- home to a pristine jungle

**Romol Village - Orou Sapulot**
- community based sustainability programmes
- a lot of erosion had taken place
- preventing oil and timber companies $\implies$ audit these companies
- raising awareness of what is left
	- bring tourists and outsiders
	- ecotourism $\implies$ members of the local community see the value of ecotourism
		- need to have locals involved in sustainability and ecotourism efforts
	- no exploitation of people and the land $\implies$ should **not** have the mindset of maximising profit

	- avoid displacement of flora and fauna
		- should have low traffic density destination (balancing tourist numbers)
		- bring in people who would appreciate these practices

	- show locals for sustainable farming instead of unsustainable practices
		- timber cutting

- ecotourism
	- need to balance timber cutting meant for economic and tourism activities (i.e. building of tourist infrastructure)
	- rubbing off each other (from the community)
	- enable more people to experience a part of ASEAN that is unique and cannot be experienced outside of this area.

- challenge: overfishing and depleting fish supplies
	- creating of ponds to rear the river fishes
	- extra fishes can be sold as a form of income


**Local Wedding**
- sustainability and ecotourism is also about learning about the culture of the local people
	- dance performance during wedding is a good example of cultural preservation efforts

### Case Study 3: Hoi An, Vietnam
- used to be a busy trading port
- centuries old architecture

**Tra Que Village**
- is near a village and lagoon
- algae used as a fertilizer
- Que vegetable farms are becoming a tourist attraction
