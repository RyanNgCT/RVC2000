## Seminar 1 recap
### Definition of cultures
- may **not** be entirely coherent, even though usually classified as such
- mental programming and unconscious learns patterns of thinking
- culture is not entirely **inherited**, but rather learnt (usually is a combination of both)
- what constitutes a hero of a country???
	- tangible or intangible? visible or not?

- culture is not only something in the past, lifestyle is part of culture
	- what do you eat?
	- what do you read?
	- how do you travel to work or commute?

- culture is **not static** and **not deterministic**

- because there are so many definitions, we can make a representative distinction of different cultural aspects using (M, S, I categories)
### Main aspects of culture
Observations and Experiences can be classified into three aspects of culture as a phenomenon
1. **Material:** using senses to interact with these (the most visible aspect)

2. **Ideational:** why people do what they do (what are the guiding behaviours)
	- refers to the knowledge, opinions and beliefs
	- what are the main ideas in different regions?
	- what are some people more collectivist than others?

3. **Social:** what does the society or people do and how they do it?
	- structured and uniform social interactions among members of communities

- sometimes these aspects cross classification boundaries $\implies$ after deeper analysis
- the three aspects have bidirectional arrow $\implies$ interconnected relations

**Bloom (DIE)**
Framework is used when we analyse culture
- Describe: value-neutral or objective description of something
- Interpret
- Evaluate

### The Onion Model
- centre: represents core values
- Intercultural Stereotyping: give general labels to others, without considering the complexity
	- logic behind the reasoning is different

### Impact of cultural on Wellbeing and Standards of Living
- what is the idea of a good life? (up to interpretation)
	- how much we are willing to do to achieve this?

- hierarchy of cultures?
	- indigenous people versus those white people

### Readings
- overgeneralization and national stereotyping (assumes national culture is uniform and cultures are static $\implies$ not true)
	- not a good sample, due to just all males
	- not statistically sufficient
	- national $\neq$ culture

- methodological issues (outdated)
- limited sample, not representative and cannot generalize from results
- cultural dimensions are not universal $\not \forall$
- neglect of individual agency
	- deterministic approach
	- framework suggests that culture determines behaviour, but individuals can act against cultural norms

- very often, we assume without asking about the actual intention of a cultural practices
### SDGs
- need to customize and localize targets to make it fit into the local cultural realities
### Spirals Framework (using the first $5$ mainly)
- used to evaluate the sustainability of a project
	- Scalability: being open to conversation, applicable to other areas?
	- Place-making: the solution should be rooted in local cultural contexts (local reality)
	- Intergenerational: ensures fulfilment in future communities as well (not just the present)
	- Resilient: flexibility of the solution, withstanding interruptions
	- Accessible: ;linked to inclusivity (who is included and who is left out)
	- (Life-affirming)
	- (Self-care)

### Main Issues in the Kelab Alami Reading
- what are the main issues
	- environmental conservation and ecological degradation
	- poverty (economic challenges)

- solution(s)
	- introduction of sustainable tourism, based on local manpower
	- have a broad understanding of culture and local context

**WHY?**
- how is something in culture leading to the issues or prevent the issue from being solved.

- need to keep in mind what is the main point, don't side-track and go down a rabbit hole
