## Seminar 1 recap
### Definition of cultures
- may **not** be entirely coherent, even though usually classified as such
- mental programming and unconscious learns patterns of thinking
- culture is not entirely **inherited**, but rather learnt (usually is a combination of both)
- what constitutes a hero of a country???
	- tangible or intangible? visible or not?

- culture is not only something in the past, lifestyle is part of culture
	- what do you eat?
	- what do you read?
	- how do you travel to work or commute?

### Main aspects of culture
Observations and Experiences can be classified into three aspects of culture as a phenomenon
1. **Material:** using senses to interact with these (the most visible aspect)

2. **Ideational:** why people do what they do (what are the guiding behaviours)
	- refers to the knowledge, opinions and beliefs
	- what are the main ideas in different regions?
	- what are some people more collectivist than others?

3. **Social:** what does the society or people do and how they do it?
	- structured and uniform social interactions among members of communities

- sometimes these aspects cross classification boundaries $\implies$ after deeper analysis
- the three aspects have bidirectional arrow $\implies$ interconnected relations

**Bloom (DIE)**
Framework is used when we analyse culture
- Describe: value-neutral or objective description of something
- Interpret
- Evaluate

### The Onion Model
- centre: represents core values
- Intercultural Stereotyping: give general labels to others, without considering the complexity
	- logic behind the reasoning is different

### Impact of cultural on Wellbeing and Standards of Living
