## 1. Sabah & Sarawak
- home to some of the most indigenous groups in SEA
	- different tribes have different distinct cultures: head hunting, fishing and agriculture
- High Risk region for clashing of indigenous land rights in Sabah

- face systematic discrimination by urban stakeholders
#### Environmental Conservation
- indigenous tribes rely on the forest for materials and resources
#### Community-based Conservation
- management of natural resources
#### Sustainable livelihoods and Economy

#### Ecotourism and Cultural Tourism

#### Renewable Energy and Green Practices
- agricultural practices
- river management
- resource management
	- reduce damage to crops

### Key Challenges to Localised Development
- inadequate indigenous land rights
	- laws not properly implemented and enforced
	- lack of formal recognition of land (land is taken away by force)
	- lack of financial resources for legal support in court

- Cash Crop Dependency
	- high reliance on palm oil as a source of income (more profitable from traditional agricultural crops)
	- land cleared belonging to indigenous tribes

#### Existing Stakeholders & Solutions
**Sabah**
1. PACOS trust
	1. help indigenous communities to be financially independent
2. Original Sabah
	1. reach a wider customer base with the agricultural produce

**Sarawak**
1. RAYS Summit 2024
	1. advocating for indigenous communities

### Activity
1. Budgeting from an economic standpoint, care for Welfare of the people so you get votes
2. NGOs help to fill gaps the the government can not fulfil, Government goes on the ground to understand various stakeholders needs, makes trade offs as necessary
3. How are you going to use the funding allocated to you?

- Locally grown chicken incorporated in meals

- Green Involvement Initiatives
	- Selangor Cleaning Project
	- River for water supply (clean water and sanitation)

- lack of interest and engagement
