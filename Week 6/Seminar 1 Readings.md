## Reading 1:  Tapestry: The Heart of ASEAN - S1E2: Homage to Nature

### Conservation Efforts (Sustainability)
#### Case Study 1: Lobo, Philippines 
- increasing threats to wildlife emerging (marine and wildlife)
	- from climate change, fishing and local developments
	- from ecotourism

- other threats: gold mining
	- land gazetted as a natural park for visitors

**Examples of Efforts**
- Education for tourists and locals to maintain and protect ecosystems like mangroves, how they help lessen impact of natural disasters and the risk of loss of species if not protected
- seafood using sustainable food practices

- no-fishing zones in certain areas in Lobo, enforcing and patrolling these areas to enforce this zone $\implies$ by volunteering as an **eco-warrior**
	- prevent over-fishing and commercial fishing practices in higher-risk areas
	- this is a sustainable practice in the long term as it helps guarantee a steady stream of seafood supply for fishermen and thus retaining their livelihoods as well
	- shift basis to enforce the zone and fishing regulations 24/7

- Planting of artificial corals
	- provides an alternative fishing ground outside of the no-fishing zones $\implies$ attract large fish and allow fishermen to sustain their livelihoods
	- growth of natural corals over artificial ones to establish new coral colonies

- Sustainability Coalition
	- whole ecosystem, with multiple stakeholder represented

**Issues with fishing**
- no guarantee or certainty of the amount of catch

#### Case Study 2: Using floodwaters for agriculture in Cambodia (Floating rice cultivation)
- farming method is slowly disappearing in Cambodia
- in some villages, floating rice cultivation is still being used generation after generation as an agricultural method
- lack of pesticides and fertilizers $\implies$ affect human health after consumption

**Rice Seller**
- selling the rice to external markets (neighboring countries)

#### Case Study 3: Phuket, Thailand
- problem of stray dogs $\implies$ how does this got to do with sustainability lol
- Soi Dog is an organization that addresses this problem
	- cover all aspects of stray dog management
	- primary strategy of sterilization to *keep the population under control* in a humane way
	- dog hospital
	- do not euthanize dogs unless they have low quality of life and cannot be treated
	- advocate for stray dog and animal welfare $\implies$ contributed to getting Thailand to adopt animal welfare bill in 2014
	- is a volunteer organization (not paid)
	- help to vaccinate them as well

- biggest challenge is education (the attitude)
	- how to look after stray dogs

- not easy to change behaviour of dogs

- train strays to be watch dogs
	- using CCTV or baby monitor to capture dog's behaviour and reaction to situations
	- enables people to understand that the stray dogs can help, and the fact that humans and dogs can coexist together

- should maintain the balance in biodiversity

#### Case Study 4: Sarawak, Borneo
- bird nest trade (swiftlet farming)
	- symbiotic relation between man and nature
	- both humans and the bird benefits

- success rate of foreigners in the local Borneo bird nest trade is not too good $\implies$ due to the lack of technical skills

- key challenge is the rate of repopulation of the swiftlets $\implies$ need to ensure adequate housing conditions
	- control humidity and temperature, need to feel like a cave

- system to attract insects that swiftlets pray on (compost and food material)

#### Case Study 5: Kalimantan, Borneo
- creation of green economies
- enable locals to have careers in sustainability
- Green Economy in the heart of Borneo project: promote environmentally friendly resource use and production

**Arowana fish farming**
- income for farmers
- preserving the fish in the lake during heatwave

**Efforts**
- need to preserve natural environment for future generations to enjoy, ensure that finite resources are still available in future
- Planting trees, procuring various species of fruit seeds $\implies$ help protect forest against landslides
- convince by actively doing conservation

### Reading 2: The rules of the social game. Cultures and organizations
- universal nature of cultural issues and confrontations
- have to consider aspects of conflict in non-technical sense as well
	- aside from technological, medical, economic etc.

**Culture as Mental Programming**
- set of ways of thinking, feeling and acting (behavioural aspects)
- acquired mainly in early childhood, when more susceptible to learning & assimilating
	- once established, very difficult to unlearn these patterns to take on something that differs quite a bit
	- possible for deviation from these patterns in certain instances, not always have to conform to them strictly, unless computer programs

- contributing factors to the "hard-wiring"
	1. Social Environment one grew up in and that one continues to experience
		- family $\to$ neighbourhood $\to$ school $\to$ workplace (essentially the idea of a wider and wider community as one ages)
		- socio-economic status of the person $\implies$  life experiences affects one's viewpoint 

> **Culture** is the customary term for mental software
- has different meanings
	- in the context of a narrow sense / limited scope
		- tilling of the soil (Latin)
		- refinement of the mind
		- to be influenced by civilization (??)

	- broader context
		- used by anthropologists and sociologists
		- catchword or umbrella term w.r.t. patterns of thinking, feeling and acting, for both intellectual and menial tasks
		- collective phenomenon $\implies$ shared in part with those that live in the same / similar social environments
		- consists of unwritten social rules

	- is learnt, not innate
		- derived from social environment, rather than being inherited from previous generation
		- should be distinguished from human nature (which also might affect feelings and actions) as well as individual personality (that varies from one person to another)
			- human nature is too general, applicable to all humans and not subgroups (analogy being the operating system)
			- personality is too specific, unique from one person to another
				- based on traits partially inherited and partially learnt

---
## Apply D.I.E., Explain cultural and sustainability intersections
- Indigenous tribes, symbiotic relationship with nature
	- using of nature to meet human needs (pretty consistent across the globe)

- Modernism

- Distinction is problematic
	- cannot just attribute culture to solely indigenous, can be also related to capitalistic culture

- Documentaries only give the tip of the iceberg

- Need to clarify assignment details
