- not a study of Malay culture
- study of cultural phenomenon

- Key outcomes: Critical Thinking and Empathy
### Cultural and Bio-diversity
- interconnection with nature as living beings
- less species $\implies$ impact on ecosystems
	- immunity against diseases if we have increased diversity as well

- food insecurity
	- is an existential threat for all people
	- not able to defend against food security in the environment

S.E.A. is the most culturally and ecologically diverse

### Issues and threats
- progressing urbanization, deforestation etc.
- *ref supplementary reading by Wang (2022)*

### ASEAN versus SEA
- used to be an exclusive "club"
- collaborate on cultural and economic aspects
- not interfere with the internal workings of a country (other's domestic affairs)
- often compared to the European Union
	- ICJ and other sub-committees

- economic liberties provided to entrepreneurs from member states
- when combined together, it is the $5^{th}$ largest economy in the world

- a frontline for the climate crisis

### Exploring Culture
**A few definition**
- Culture is the arts and other manifestation of **human intellectual achievement**, that are regarded collectively
- Culture is the **customs, ideas and social behaviour** of a particular people or group
	- can be a product of artistic human expression


**Culture**
- distinction between material aspect (artwork, clothing, food, cutlery),
	- material $\to$ can hear, touch, smell and see
		- very much connected with the ideational aspect
	- social $\to$ language as a tool for communication, rituals, festivals, behaviour (greetings, what we do and do not do)
	- ideational $\to$ values, beliefs, assumptions
		- spaces define our behaviour

- but there are bidirectional arrows $\implies$ hence interdependent on each other

**DNA**
Born with some DNA, which are shaped over generations $\implies$ dependent on ancestral behaviour and experiences

**Socialization**
- learning what is right and wrong $\implies$ sense of self-value
- Social context matters in the growing up years
- culture is acquired, not innate, even though it becomes **natural**
	- done through observation and mimicking


**Levels of uniqueness in Mental programming**
- Human nature
- Culture
	- "hard-coded" behaviour and response, mental programming (stored in the sub-consciousness)
	- should not associate culture with nationality $\implies$ passport does not tell full story of one's cultural background
	- survival instinct, avoidance of danger
	- categorize situations into baskets

- Personality $\implies$ linked to biological form

- The Onion as a model
	- Values as the inner core
	- Practices as the outer ring, extension
		- symbols, heroes and rituals

**Intercultural Generalizations**
- informed observations that provide insights into behaviours
- may not apply for all people, not universal $\implies\exists, \: \not \forall$

**Intercultural Stereotyping**
- oversimplifies of exaggerates images or beliefs about **all members of a certain culture**

**Ethnocentrism**
- catch all term for Euro-centrism, Sino-Centrism
- applying ones cultural beliefs and norms on others
- Social Sciences favour Western-centric ideals
	- deviate from norm $\implies$ has the connotation or label of not normal

**Xenophilia**
- belief that everything is better in a foreign culture
- idealise or romanticise other groups

**World view**
- Europe and Africa
	- material aspect
	- everything else revolves around the centre
	- might not be geographically accurate

- Inherently inherit a colonial legacy

- Standards used for educational purposes

- Culture skills the view of things (see something but does not see other things)
	- lack of perspective

- Think of cultural studies as something that is foreign
	- describe, no opinions and emotions given (objective) $\implies$ about the basics
	- interpret, think about the functions
		- subject to individual's world views
	- evaluation, judgement, more emotion involved


**Sustainability Pillars**
Achieve all these goals without the expense of any of the others, since the systems are all interconnected.
- Social
- Economical
- Environmental

Not idealistic to take care of environment, but rather pragmatic reasons as well
